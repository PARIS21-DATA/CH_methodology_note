# Abstract {-}

The Clearinghouse for Financing Development Data is a dedicated platform for aid providers and 
recipients to align their priorities, optimise their decision-making and demonstrate a stronger 
case for data and statistics. To reach this goal, the platform prioritises user-focused, transparent 
and accessible information about aid flows, partners, projects and results, which build on timely, 
accurate and in-depth data.

This document explains the different data featured in the platform as of 1st November 2022, and 
details the collection, processing and analysis methodologies followed. It has been prepared by 
the Clearinghouse project team, comprised of PARIS21 and Open Data Watch, on behalf of the 
Secretariat of the Bern Network on Financing Data for Development.
